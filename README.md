# li

li is a hackable text editor, originally based on [hibiken's mini](https://github.com/hibiken/mini) which was inspired from [antirez's kilo](http://antirez.com/news/108) editor.

This project is designed to a springboard other customised versions. A big design philiosophy is that one should not have a configuration file. Or rather not one that can be read without recompiling the program. This keeps the code lean and fast.

This does not mean that you need to stop the program to recompile, in fact, you can recompile it without any visual effect
